## Intro to GitHub 

Writing in Github: search google  'git markdown syntax'. 
For example: [markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Also have a look at raw README.md code in TK's [modRSW_EnKF repository](https://github.com/tkent198/modRSW_EnKF). 

For a more in-depth introduction to GitHub, see [here](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/practicals/general/github/index.html). This may seem daunting at first but it is worth getting to grips with the basics now to make life easier in the future -- that goes for me too!

Overview of key commands from terminal: [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) and [here](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).
